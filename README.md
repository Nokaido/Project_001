## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnB data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What are the different proportions of features at the two focused cities
2. Which features are a good deal and which arn't
3. what is the relation of distance to the next main airprt the price of a rental andthe review score


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Findings:
- there is a significant difference in proportion of some features comparing rentals in Seattle and Boston
- Features can be good deals and very bad deals this is explained in a visualisation
- The distance to the next main airport has been put in relation to price and review rating showing that the price is the highest in the city center and that a close rental isn't influenced negatily by the airport

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kolbandreasmartin/this-will-make-you-more-aware-in-choosing-your-next-airbnb-a5a54c72d553).
